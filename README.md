**Motive/Goal of this Project/Repo -**

Beginners often find themselves following multiple sources simultaneously when learning JavaScript. This can lead to confusion, making their learning journey less effective and leaving them dissatisfied. Many people even give up on learning JavaScript because of these challenges.

In India, there is a book published by APC (Arya Publishing Company) specifically dedicated to Java. This book offers a well-organized and beginner-friendly approach with a systematic syllabus that covers everything you need to know. Personally, I haven't come across any other resource or video that is as organized.

Recognizing the major problem of disorganized information, I decided to tackle it head-on. I created a project to address this core issue by structuring all the topics into chapters. Additionally, I provide detailed explanations in my personal notes, making it easier for developers of all skill levels, including non-developers, to learn JavaScript without any hassle.

Although it may seem simple, disorganized information is a significant problem. I, myself, used to follow three different YouTube channels to understand the same topic, which raised concerns for me which resulted this Project.

Now, the aim of this project is twofold. Firstly, it serves as tangible proof of my proficiency in JavaScript. Secondly, it is designed to assist beginners and non-tech individuals in easily learning JavaScript. Additionally, the project aims to showcase my JavaScript expertise to prospective clients, HR managers, and companies.

Moreover, it provides a unique and interactive learning experience through projects organized by chapters. As the project evolves, the goal is to transform it into a recognizable brand. This transformation includes generating revenue, enabling active contributors to receive rewards and monetary prizes. In some instances, the project may even lead to hiring dedicated individuals who share a commitment to its success.
